Being the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon, gave them plenty of time for shenanigans- which would often continue at the Dahmen household. Nerf wars, pillow forts and other adventures usually drew in Bo as well. Because she was older, Lisa held the honor of being taller than Bo until his freshman year of high school but once Bo surpassed her, he made sure she was aware of it. After an incident in the high school cafeteria, where Bo and his friends sang the \"Lollipop Guild\" as Lisa walked past, she felt the need to get his cell phone number so that she could scold him about it. One thing led to another, and they became daily texters; texts turned into walks around the neighborhood, which turned into exchanges of poetry and music, which in turn led to a deep understanding of each other and a friendship that neither expected. The day before starting college at UW-Whitewater together, Bo asked Lisa if he could tell her a secret. When she said yes, he kissed her, and the rest is history.",
